This project analyzes Airbnb listings in New York City to understand market conditions and customer preferences following the pandemic's impact on travel.
Key Findings:

Pricing: Entire houses/apartments are generally more expensive than private or shared rooms, with Manhattan being the most expensive borough overall.
Popularity: Private rooms are most popular across New York, with Staten Island seeing the highest concentration. Manhattan listings have lower average review ratings.
Guest Preferences: Short stays (1-5 days) and longer stays (30 days) are most popular. Customers seem to favor listings displayed with low availability.

Recommendations:

Pricing Strategies: Adjust pricing based on location and room type. For example, consider lowering Manhattan apartment prices and raising private room prices in Queens.
Improve Manhattan Listings: Address the lower review ratings in Manhattan to enhance guest experience.
Cater to Popular Preferences: Offer more short- and long-term stay options and consider highlighting low availability to attract customers.
